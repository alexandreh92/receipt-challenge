# ReceiptChallenge

This project is a challenge which implements a REPL system which adds products to a list and generates the total price and total taxes.

## How to run?

  Clone the project and then run:

  ```bash
  ./bin/setup
  ./bin/run
  ```

## How to run specs?

  ```bash
    rspec
  ```

## How can it be improved?

- By improvements on REPL system, or adding a gem to do this job for us;
- Better error handling;
- By adding a validation system inside the models;
- By increasing specs coverage.
